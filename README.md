Run the program in Linux
Always start with this step when running the programs
1. If you ran the program previously and want to run it again, you need to do the follpowing step to restart:
   - folder "changesets"
   - file "differences.txt"
   - folder "test_case" and file "file1v1.java" inside folder "firstv"
   - rename file "original.java" to "file1v1.java"
2. Place the previous version of your file into the folder labeled "firstv". In the source code provided in the homework, this would be "file1v1.java"
3. Place the updated version of your file into the folder labeled "secondv". In the source code provided in the homework, this would be "file1v2.java"
4. Open your terminal in the directory where "deltadebugger.py" and "fileman.py" are located.
5. Run "python3 fileman.py" in your terminal.
6. You will be prompted for 2 file names. For the first file name, type the full name of the previous program. In the source code for the homework, this would be "file1v1.java". For the second prompt, this would be "file1v2.java".
7. Run "python3 deltadebugger.py" in your terminal. 
8. The output should be the results of the algorithm
